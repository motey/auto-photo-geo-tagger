# Ideas

* Create a metadata file in every directory with a hash of all photo pathes if all images in a dir are tagged. this way we can recheck every run if we need to touch this dir again. this can improve perfomance after initals runs dramactly

# Current issues

* agpt.tools.probe_timezones_in_track_section() return an empty set in tests
