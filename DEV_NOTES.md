# Ideas

* Create a metadata file in every directory with a hash of all photo pathes if all images in a dir are tagged. this way we can recheck every run if we need to touch this dir again. this can improve perfomance after initals runs dramactly

# Current issues

* EXIF timestamps can contain utc offset https://stackoverflow.com/a/70253990/12438690
